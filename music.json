It marks a deliberate attempt by the band to move away from the introspective guitar-oriented sound of their previous album The Bends. Its layered sound and wide range of influences set it apart from many of the Britpop and alternative Rock bands popular at the time and laid the groundwork for Radiohead's later, more experimental work.\n      "}]},{"name":"Portishead","albums":[{"title":"Dummy","songs":[{"title":"Mysterons","length":"5:02","genre":"Alterantive rock"},{"title":"Sour Times","length":"4:11","genre":"Alterantive rock"},{"title":"Strangers","length":"3:55","genre":"Alterantive rock"},{"title":"It Could Be Sweet","length":"4:16","genre":"Alterantive rock"},{"title":"Wandering Star","length":"4:51","genre":"Alterantive rock"},{"title":"It's a Fire","length":"3:49","genre":"Alterantive rock"},{"title":"Numb","length":"3:54","genre":"Alterantive rock"},{"title":"Roads","length":"5:02","genre":"Alterantive rock"},{"title":"Pedestal","length":"3:39","genre":"Alterantive rock"},{"title":"Biscuit","length":"5:01","genre":"Alterantive rock"},{"title":"Glory Box","length":"5:06","genre":"Alterantive rock"}],"description":"\n\tDummy is the debut album of the Bristol-based group Portishead.

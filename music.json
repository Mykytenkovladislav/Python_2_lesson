      "description": "\n\tOK Computer is the third studio album by the English alternative Rock band Radiohead, released on 16 June 1997 on Parlophone in the United Kingdom and 1 July 1997 by Capitol Records in the United States. It marks a deliberate attempt by the band to move away from the introspective guitar-oriented sound of their previous album The Bends. Its layered sound and wide range of influences set it apart from many of the Britpop and alternative Rock bands popular at the time and laid the groundwork for Radiohead's later, more experimental work.\n      "
